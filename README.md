# Airbnb-New-User-Booking

## Use Case

In this project, we try to predict the booking destination of a newly onboarded user on Airbnb platform. The predictors used in this project are only the
listing titles. To evaluate the model's performance, we used NDCG as the metric to improve the degree of relevance and the ranking of the predictions we make. 
With this, Airbnb could potentially 
- Provide personalized experience
- Better forecast demand
